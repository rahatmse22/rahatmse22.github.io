      <img src="images/profile.jpg" class="avatar" alt="Profile Photo">
      <p>A movie and book enthusiast with a deep love for nature. I enjoy spending hours immersed in a good story or simply wandering outdoors, letting the world around me inspire reflection. Adaptability is one of my greatest strengths, allowing me to embrace new experiences with ease and curiosity. I cherish meaningful moments with family and friends, and I believe that staying organized is the first step toward achieving anything worthwhile.</p>
