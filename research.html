          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a new class of structural materials offering exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance under extreme service conditions. Among them, body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory HEAs are particularly attractive but remain less understood compared to their FCC counterparts. This study aims to elucidate the mechanical response and deformation mechanisms of single-crystal HfNbTaTiZr HEA under varying thermal and loading conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, based on a modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential, were carried out under uniaxial tension at five temperatures (100–1200 K) and four strain rates (0.0005–0.01 ps-1). Stress–strain analysis revealed a maximum ultimate tensile strength (13.94 GPa) and Young’s modulus (180.14 GPa) at 100 K and the highest strain rate. Both properties decreased with temperature due to atomic softening but increased with strain rate as limited time for defect evolution enhanced strength. Adaptive common neighbor analysis (ACNA) showed that BCC-to-amorphous transformation is the primary deformation mechanism, while intrinsic stacking faults dominate at elevated temperatures and low strain rates. These results advance the understanding of temperature- and strain-rate-dependent behavior in refractory HEAs, offering guidance for the design of BCC HEAs with improved mechanical performance for high-temperature applications.</p>

          <h4 class="title-green">Md Riazul Islam, Jahirul Islam, <strong>Rahat Hasan</strong>, Mahmudul Hasan. <em>Effect of alloying element content, temperature, and strain rate on the mechanical behavior of NbTiZrMoV high entropy alloy: A molecular dynamics study.</em></h4>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High entropy alloys (HEAs) have drawn attention among researchers due to their excellent mechanical properties at low and high temperatures, which pave the way for their numerous applications in various sectors. In this study, we have investigated the effect of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical properties of single crystal equimolar NbTiZrMoV alloy, a refractory HEA (RHEA), using molecular dynamics simulation with the help of a newly developed modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential. Uniaxial tensile simulations were conducted along x-direction at temperatures between 77 K and 600 K, with temperature intervals of 100 K, and at strain rates of 0.001 ps−1, 0.005 ps−1, 0.025 ps−1, and 0.125 ps−1. Stress-strain curves were plotted, and tensile properties of the alloy were calculated. Results show that tensile strength and elastic modulus decrease with temperature, but strain rate improves the properties. Mo increases strength while Nb reduces it, offering insights into applications of NbTiZrMoV HEA in varied conditions.</p>
